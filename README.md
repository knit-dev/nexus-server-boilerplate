# nexus-server-boilerplate

> Backend for bills app

This is a **GraphQL server with TypeScript** with the following stack:

- [**Apollo Server**](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/apollo-server/): HTTP server for GraphQL APIs
- [**GraphQL Nexus**](https://nexusjs.org/docs/): GraphQL schema definition and resolver implementation
- [**Prisma Client**](https://www.prisma.io/docs/concepts/components/prisma-client): Databases access (ORM)
- [**Prisma Migrate**](https://www.prisma.io/docs/concepts/components/prisma-migrate): Database migrations
- [**Prisma Studio**](https://www.prisma.io/docs/concepts/components/prisma-studio): GUI to view and edit data in your database

## Getting Started

### 1. Install dependencies

```sh
npm install
```

### 2. Create and seed the database

Make sure [Docker](https://www.docker.com) is installed and running locally.

Run a Docker container for your postgres instance.

```sh
docker run --name 'postgres' --detach --publish 5432:5432 -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=postgres postgres
console.log("ðŸš€ ~ file: README.md ~ line 36 ~ docker run --name 'postgres' --detach --publish 5432:5432 -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=postgres postgres", docker run --name 'postgres' --detach --publish 5432:5432 -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=postgres postgres)
```

Configure an environment file for Prisma to connect with your postgres instance. You may also need to setup a shadow database (e.g. with Docker) to run migrations against a Heroku db instance (since it doesn't allow creates).

```sh
touch prisma/.env && echo "DATABASE_URL=\"postgresql://postgres:postgres@localhost:5432/myapp\"" > prisma/.env
```

Run the following command to create the project database on your Docker instance.

```sh
npx prisma db push
```

Now, seed the database with the sample data in [`prisma/seed.ts`](./prisma/seed.ts) by running the following command:

```sh
npx prisma db seed --preview-feature
```

### 3. Configure environment variables

Several features require valid environment variables (defined, for example, in a [`root .env file`](./.env)) to function properly.

Below are listed only those variables necessary for base functionality. Examine the codebase for instances of `process.env.` to determine if you need to provide additional variables.

_Note:_ Replace `__YOUR_{VARIABLE_NAME}__` placeholders with appropriate values.

#### Authentication

```sh
AUTH0_DOMAIN=__YOUR_AUTH0_DOMAIN__
AUTH0_AUDIENCE=__YOUR_AUTH0_AUDIENCE__
SIGNUP_KEY=__YOUR_SIGNUP_KEY__
```

#### File upload

```sh
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=__YOUR_AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY__
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=__YOUR_AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID__
AWS_S3_BUCKET=__YOUR_AWS_S3_BUCKET__
// ... other AWS config variables
```

### 4. Start the GraphQL server

Launch your GraphQL server with this command:

```sh
npm run dev
```

Navigate to [http://localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000) in your browser to explore the API of your GraphQL server in [Apollo Sandbox](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/studio/explorer/#account-free-sandbox), a special instance of [Apollo Studio Explorer](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/studio/explorer/).

## Using the GraphQL API

The schema that specifies the API operations of the GraphQL server is defined in [`./schema.graphql`](./schema.graphql). Below is an example operation that you can send to the API using the Apollo Sandbox or any other graphql query method.

Adjust the example operation by adding or removing fields. The Apollo Sandbox helps you with its auto-completion and query validation features.

### Retrieve all users

```graphql
query {
  users {
    id
    email
    profile {
      id
      firstName
      lastName
    }
  }
}
```

### Authenticating

Valid access tokens are required for some endpoints. Make sure a valid authentication token is sent along with the `Bearer`-prefix in the `Authorization` header of the request:

```json
{
  "Authorization": "Bearer __YOUR_TOKEN__"
}
```

### Generate GraphQL types

Use the [Apollo CLI](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/devtools/cli/) to download the GraphQL schema and/or generate static types for GraphQL queries.

## Explore and manipulate data

Prisma maintains a tool for visualizing and editing data in your database called [Prisma Studio](https://github.com/prisma/studio).

Run this database IDE from the command line with `npx prisma studio`.

## Evolving the app

Evolving the application typically requires two steps:

1. Migrate your database using Prisma Migrate
1. Update the application code

### 1. Migrate your database using Prisma Migrate

Make changes to the [Prisma schema file](./prisma/schema.prisma) and then run a migration afterwards:

```diff
// ./prisma/schema.prisma

model User {
  id        Int      @id @default(autoincrement())
  createdAt DateTime @default(now())
  updatedAt DateTime @updatedAt
+ isDeleted Boolean  @default(false)
  email     String   @unique
}

// other models
```

Once you've updated the data model, you can execute the changes against your database with the following command:

```sh
npm run migrate:dev
```

This adds another migration to the `prisma/migrations` directory and adjusts the database.

### 2. Update the application code

You can now use the `PrismaClient` instance to perform operations against the adjusted database. Those operations can be used to implement queries and mutations in the GraphQL API.

#### 2.1. Adding a type to the GraphQL schema

First, add a new GraphQL type via Nexus' `objectType` function.

Don't forget to include new types in the `types` array that's passed to `makeSchema` by exporting any new files added to `src/nexusTypes` in [`src/nexusTypes/index.ts`](src/nexusTypes/index.ts).

Note that in order to resolve any type errors, your development server needs to be running so that the Nexus types can be generated. If it's not running, you can start it with `npm run dev`.

#### 2.2. Adding a GraphQL query / mutation

Use `extendType` with relevant `type` option.
